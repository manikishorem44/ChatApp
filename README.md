# ChatApp
ChatApp is a chat application developed with a custom designed chat protocol using tcp sockets. UI for this application is made using Tinker. 

# Steps to execute code:
1.	Download and paste the folder ‘mmedam’ on your desktop.
2.	Open your command prompt/ terminal.
3.	Navigate to the folder containing the scripts using following commands,
------ cd  <directory name>
Continue until you reach the folder ‘mmedam’
 

4.	Run the server script by using the following command,
------ Python server.py
 





5.	Now open another terminal/ command prompt and run the client script.
-----python client.py
As soon as you run this command, it will ask for host IP in the terminal. Enter Host IP as ‘127.0.0.1’ and press enter.
 

6.	Now go to the UI screen (chat screen) that popped out after running the client script. It will ask for Username and password.
Enter any of the following below Username and password,

Mani | Mani@123
Kishore | Kishore@123
